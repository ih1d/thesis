\section{Introduction}

Machine learning (ML) is often considered a programming paradigm like imperative
and functional \cite{omlpl}. This means that one can create (or discover \cite{props}) a programming
language (PL) with the appropriate verbs. 

In an exhaustive code review study of machine learning programs that
were trying to change from imperative to graph execution \cite{imptograph}
a large number of bugs were found and classified. These bugs can be a result
of a lack of a universal language \cite{omlpl}.

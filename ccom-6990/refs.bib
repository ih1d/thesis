  annotate={This paper discusses how TensorFlow works under the hood, by explaining a very limited version of TensorFlow's dataflow computational model.
  The limited version contains variables, tensors, and read and write operations on variables. The authors explain the semantics of these operations, and how the dataflow graph behaves.}

  annotate={This paper argues that a new language for machine learning is needed. There are various arguments: libraries like TensorFlow 
  are already languages in themselves, current languages work as meta-languages, and a new language could improve certain features.
  This source is helpful because it lays the basis, informally, as to what is needed for a programming language based on machine learning.
  Its goal is to explain what features such a language has, what similarities it has with other languages, and how does it differ from conventional
  programming languages. It changes the approach on how to implement a language or what the target of my language should be.}

abstract = {Efficiency is essential to support responsiveness w.r.t. ever-growing datasets, especially for Deep Learning (DL) systems. DL frameworks have traditionally embraced deferred execution-style DL code that supports symbolic, graph-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) computation. While scalable, such development tends to produce DL code that is error-prone, non-intuitive, and difficult to debug. Consequently, more natural, less error-prone imperative DL frameworks encouraging eager execution have emerged at the expense of run-time performance. While hybrid approaches aim for the "best of both worlds," the challenges in applying them in the real world are largely unknown. We conduct a data-driven analysis of challenges---and resultant bugs---involved in writing reliable yet performant imperative DL code by studying 250 open-source projects, consisting of 19.7 MLOC, along with 470 and 446 manually examined code patches and bug reports, respectively. The results indicate that hybridization: (i) is prone to API misuse, (ii) can result in performance degradation---the opposite of its intention, and (iii) has limited application due to execution mode incompatibility. We put forth several recommendations, best practices, and anti-patterns for effectively hybridizing imperative DL code, potentially benefiting DL practitioners, API designers, tool developers, and educators.},

annotate={This paper surveys and reviews more than 19 million lines of code to try and identify common bugs 
on code that migrates imperative style to graph execution programs. This source helps by reinforcing my idea since it presents a large amount
of bugs and performance issues. The source can be used as a metric to show how a language can improve the code quality or performance.}
